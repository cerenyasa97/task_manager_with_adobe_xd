## Description
A Task Manager application has been developed in the project. The interface of the application is designed using Adobe XD. In the application, the tasks are shown to the user through a container with background colors determined according to their priority values. Clicking on the task cards shows detailed information of the tasks, and here some options are presented to the user regarding the tasks. 
The completion status of the tasks is understood through the Containers located on the upper left of the cards. The task is complete if the Container is full, or not completed if not.
A separate page has been prepared to add a task. On this page, the user enters the task information and saves the task in a local database.
Tasks can be deleted or updated with the buttons under the dialog that displays detailed information. For the task update, the user is directed to the new task page with the task information and completes the registration by making the necessary changes. Pages of the project are given in the picture below.
